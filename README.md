# Spam–Ham Classification — Model Training & Evaluation
A machine learning project focused on classifying text messages as Spam or Ham. Includes end-to-end NLP preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization), feature extraction, TF-IDF vectorization, model training, and performance evaluation.

# Overview

This project builds a machine learning model to classify text messages as Spam or Ham. It includes complete NLP preprocessing, feature engineering, vectorization, and model training using classical algorithms. The goal of the project is to understand how text data is cleaned, transformed, and evaluated to create an effective spam detection model.
